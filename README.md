# GUI-VoleMachineLanguageSimulator
A Machine language simulator based on the machine language described in the book Computer Science: An Overview (12th Edition) made as a part of the CS213 course. 

# How this was made 
This program was made in C++ and uses the dear ImGui library for its UI. 
This program was split into two parts:       

1- The UI, which is a class that takes events from the backend and the things it should display and displays them.         

2- The backend, this is the actual program, this is where all of the error checking and program logic is stored.        
 
The UI is inside of the UI files, and the backend is inside of the Machine, Cpu and Program files.
